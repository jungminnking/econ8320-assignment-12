    "## Defining Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue further into our content this semester, you have probably noticed that each tool takes us to a new level of being able to conduct analysis with less code. As we progress, we move toward what are called \"higher level\" programming tools. Python itself is a high-level programming language, meaning that it is written in a way that is easier for humans to read than computers, with lots of translation happening behind the scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like `pandas` remove a lot of the manual work from data processing. `numpy` and `scipy` handle much of the mathematical and statistical work that we want to do with our data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a tool similar to regex, but allowing us to take our text analytics to entirely new levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where regex allows us to look for text-based patterns in our words or string content, we want to go further. We want to look for **meaning**-based content. How do I find content that reflects anger? What words are most common in those contexts? What about when the content reflects joy? Sadness? Regex is not enough in these cases, and so we build to an even more powerful tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a broad set of tools designed in order to enable users to work with text in ways that a human might work with text. When we work with text, we look for structures like sentences, and within those sentences we look for nouns to tell us who or what is the focus of the content. We look for verbs to understand what is happening. Adjectives and other descriptors help us to better understand the nuances of context. NLP models are trained to recognize these elements in text, and to be able to leverage that content to break text down and provide human users valuable information at a larger scale than would be possible if the document were simply read (slowly) by a human.\n",

    "## What NLP can do\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can NLP do for us?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify parts of speech\n",
    "\n",
    "When we pass a document (really a string, but typically we provide a fairly large string to an NLP algorithm) to an NLP model, it is able to identify parts of speech (nouns, verbs, etc.). This enables us to quickly break down our text to find various kinds of keywords, and is the first step in many more complex pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterate over sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP can identify sentences within a document. This makes for a powerful iterative tool, as we will be able to define a processing pipeline for each sentence, and then apply that pipeline to as many sentences as exist within our document, without having to write complex code to try and recognize where each sentence starts and ends (this is MUCH harder than it sounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find words used to describe various nouns (or anything else!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond simply identifying parts of speech, NLP models can be used to build a structural dependency tree of each sentence. This structure allows us to associate adjectives with their respective nouns, or adverbs to the verb that they modify. We can explore how various entities are described in our document based on word associations. We can even visualize the structure of the sentence using simple mapping functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter text for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use NLP to filter our text. We can look for sentences about a specific entity, or explore other ways of filtering our text in order to create a better understanding of overall patterns in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conduct sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful capabilities resulting from NLP models is the ability to analyze sentiment within the text. Words have the ability to convey literal meanings, as well as the more subtle capacity to convey emotion. By looking for word combinations in our text, NLP models can provide sentiment measurements at the word, sentence, or document level. This provides the ability to sort through texts for specific sentiments to learn about the way in which emotion affects the outcomes we are examining in text. One example might be looking through descriptions for negative emotions, and being able to respond to unhappy customers by flagging negative descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing NLP models\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with NLP models, we need to install the right libraries (and a corpus!). The library that we will use is `spacy`, although there are multiple other options available to us. One other common NLP library is `nltk`, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). In my experience NLTK is more commonly employed when someone wants to create their own model from scratch, rather than implement pre-built and optimized NLP models. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a library to conduct NLP, we also rely on a **corpus**. A corpus is essentially a model of a specific language that is built to enable the actual analysis. `spacy` as a library is a general structure that can be implemented on ANY language. The corpus allows us to select a specific language, and a model of that language built on a specific set of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we install `spacy`, we will also download the `en_core_web_sm` corpus. This corpus is a small-sized model of the english language, and was trained on web-based data. That means that it will perform best on data drawn from websites, and is not as strong a model for other contexts (like analyzing Pride and Prejudice). That doesn't mean that we can't use in other contexts, but it does suggest that results will not be as refined or accurate."

',\n",

    "### Understanding tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that each word is represented as a token in the processed document. These tokens are immensely powerful. They are the word, but also more than that. Words in the English language are often modified based on context. Verbs are conjugated, nouns may be plural, among many possibilities. Each word is **tokenized** through our corpus in order to identify the underlying word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important, because we might want to look for each instance of a single word in our corpus. Let's say that we want to find every instance of \"eat\". If we look for \"eat\", we want to make sure that \"eats\" and \"ate\", as well as \"eating\" and other forms are all considered. This is where tokenization becomes critical. Each token contains the text value from the original document, but also the **lemmatized** word. The lemma is the base form of the word, allowing us to search for lemmas rather than the text word. This streamlines our ability to analyze text by focusing on lemmas rather than unprocessed text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other valuable attributes are also associated with our tokens:\n",
    "- `lemma_` - the \"root word\" from which a token/word is derived\n",
    "- `pos_` - the part of speech of a token/word\n",
    "- `dep_` - the relationship of dependent tokens to the parent token (adjectives to nouns, etc.)\n",
    "- `like_email`/`like_num`/`like_url` - check if a token is like an email, number, or url (unlikely in Jane Eyre)\n",
